Understanding the processes generating global biodiversity patterns is a central goal in evolutionary research. Here, we studied geographic patterns of richness-corrected phylogenetic diversity (residual PD) in four major clades of tetrapods, identifying regions with species phylogenetically more closely or distantly related than expected by richness. We explored the effect of different factors (speciation rates, trends of lineage accumulation, and environmental variables), searching for evolutionary and ecological differences between regions of high and low residual PD. Our results reveal a nuanced relationship between recent speciation rates and residual PD, underscoring the role of recent speciation events in structuring current biogeographic patterns. Furthermore, we found differences between endotherms and ectotherms in response to climate, highlighting the pivotal role of thermal physiology in shaping diversity dynamics. By illuminating the multifaceted factors underpinning global patterns, our study represents a significant advancement towards more holistic conservation approaches that are crucial to facing ongoing environmental challenges.
