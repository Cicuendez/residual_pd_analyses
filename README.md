# Data from: Geographic patterns of living tetrapod diversity reveal the signature of global diversification dynamics

## Code/Software

This dataset contains the scripts (R code) used to perform the analyses and generate the figures in the manuscript. All the data used are published somewhere else and properly referenced in the text.

## Description of the code and file structure

The scripts used to prepare the distribution and phylogenetic data for subsequent analyses were repeated for the different groups of tetrapods independently, and therefore they are distributed in different subfolders: amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamates.

The scripts used to perform the final analyses and produce the figures including all groups are found in the main folder.
